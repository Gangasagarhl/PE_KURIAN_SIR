# PE_KURIAN_SIR â€“ 2-Tier Smart Security System

A Python-based 2-tier security system that detects emergencies from the environment, captures a 12-second video, generates a natural language summary using T5, and sends alerts to the owner (and optionally to neighbors/friends). The system ensures timely response through email and optional WhatsApp API-based notifications.
